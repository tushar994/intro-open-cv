## Problem 1

In this problem, we had to convert a given video into its constituent frames (part a) and we had to write another program to convert a set of frames into a video (part b). 


They codes are in 1.py and 1b.py.


You will need to have cv2 installed, which can be done with pip.

## Problem 2
In this problem, we had to stream video from our webcam and save each frame from the stream.


They codes are in 2.py.


## Problem 3
In this problem, we had to take two videos and use the concept of crome keying to overlap them. 

The code is in chroma.py
